# Disclaimer <a name="disclaimer"></a>
All the information that I am given is based on my knowledge. In some area I might be wrong and in other area I will just voice out my opinion.<br>
Goal of this channel isn't to argue over the best way to do X but just to give basic info for new and returning players.<br>
Note about myself :
- English isn't my primary language
- I've been playing on and off Albion Online since beta (part of last 2 phase of beta)
- I enjoy playing range DPS the most but tend to play healers due to the rarity in them.
- Outside of buying the Epic Founder's Pack (50$USD Value), I didn't spend any RL mney on the game and I've been premium since launch.

# Important note on Albion <a name="important"></a>
As many of you know, Albion have a player driven economy and unless you played MMOs with that core concept, they are few key difference that make this game somewhat unique. 
- First and foremost, once you realize that you enjoy the game and can see yourself playing for couple months, **premium** is the first and most important goal to reach in Albion. If you really enjoy the game, its even something I would suggest to people to spend 10-15$ to get premium right away instead of farming it up in game.
- Secondly, if they was a very super easy way to make silver, everyone would do it and dry up the market, making it not as profitable. They aren't any secret tricks. Most of the sustainable silver making in this game that are risk free come from investing into something (buildings or your own character) and receive benefits long term. Of course, they is also the option of taking risk doing various activities to gain silver.
- Lastly, almost everything in Albion can be represented by silver value. A lot of  new player want to be Jack of all trade and want to do everything by themselves thinking its the best way to do things. Its not, its actually one of the worse way silver wise to do things.

# Learning points, fame credits & tome of insights <a name="learning"></a>

## Learning points <a name="learningpoints"></a>
###What are learning points
- Learning points are a ressource that a player gain by either completing the daily adventure challenge or simply having premium active. It is gain at 30 points per day and doesn't have any cap as far as I know.
- Learning points are used to finish a level of almost any node on your destiny board once you reach 20% of completion.
- The original design was to help casual player catch up with the more hardcode players.

### Best used to spend learning points

For me, they are 3 ways to spend LP, from most efficient to worse
1. Unlocking a new tier of gathering (will give you access to higher tier harvest gear, tool, rare ressource and ressource)
2. If you plan to be spend agood amount of time gathering, spending LP to level up those gathering node could be very benefical
3. Finishing up a weapon specialization from 95-100

**Learning points are the ONLY thing in game to speed up your gathering proces, any other node on the destiny board can be speedup with silver**

## Fame Credit <a name="famecredit"></a>
Another misunderstood topic in AO are fame credits.
- Fame credits are earn by wearing a satchel of insights or faming when one of the combat node is max out (can be any numbers of them)
- Fame credit will slowly bleed out your silver (unless you disactivated it on your destiny board, this will cut all ratio by 4)
- Each slot will generate a different amount of fame credit following the following ratio
  - Weapon : 40%
  - Chest Armor : 20%
  - Helmet & Shoes : 10%
  - Offhand : 2.5%
- More max out combat node, means more fame credit and both node count (the main middle one and the specialized one)
- Examples : 
  - I am maxed out Holy Staff healer with 90 spec into Fallen staff. Holy staff is my only max out node, so I will earn .40 of any fame gain into credit.
  - I am maxed out Holy Staff healer with 100+ spec into Fallen staff. Holy staff and fallen are my max out nodes, so I will earn .40 + .40 (or .80) of any fame gain into credit.
  - I am fancy and running a fully maxed out build. Using a 2H, I will earn : .40 + .40 + .20 + .20 + .10 + .10 + .10 + .10  for 1.60 ratio of any fame gain into fame credits.
- Fame credits are used to "power level" a certain combat node on your destiny board and to level up any combat fame from 100 to 120.
- Some people suggest maxing out a very effective build and fame with that build to level up everything else, thinking its more effective then just faming with the gear you desired to level up. I highly disagree with this unless you really enjoy that weapon. It will cost you more silver in the end. Only exception to this is for very bad PvE weapons.

## Spending Fame Credit <a name="spendingfamecredit"></a>
This is 100% my own opinion but I would never recommend for anyone to spend fame credit on anything beside weapon specialization. They are the longest to level since you have 7 to do per weapon type. The only exception I would make for this is to get a middle node to level 30 so you can used T6 of that weapon / armor right away.

# Combat <a name="combat"></a>

## What contribute to the damage I do <a name="damage"></a>
Main thing contributing to your damage is your item power for your weapon. Item power for any other slot will not affect how strong you are hitting when your auto attack or any abilities.
The 2nd contributing factor is the armor type you are wearing. As you know, AO offer 3 type of armor : Plate, Leather and Cloth. Each of them have different bonus to damage.
- Plate armor damage bonus range from 0% to 10%
  - 0% : Guardian, Judicator, Valor
  - 5% : Knight, Demon, Royal
  - 10% : Soldier, Graveguard
- Leather jacket damage bonus from 20% to 30%
  - 20% : Mercenary, Stalker
  - 25% : Hunter, Hellion, Royal
  - 30% : Assassin, Specter, Tenacity
- Cloth robe damage bonus from 40% to 50%
  - 40% : Scholar, Druid
  - 45% : Cleric, Fiend, Royal
  - 50% : Mage, Cultist, Purity
The 3rd contributing factor are temporary effects (royal sandals) and food effects (beef stew)
The 4th contributing factor are passive (cloth armor, leather armor, offhand stats)

As a DPS / Healer, the most important thing to remember is, having a T8 BW Cape won't do shit for your damage and the weapon IP should always be prioritize when buying gear for a given build.

On the other hand, Support and tank will tend to prioritize the chest piece IP since its the main contributor to your survivability.

## Tanking <a name="tanking"></a>

TODO !

# Silver generation <a name="silver"></a>
A big part of AO is being able to self suffice when it comes to silver generation. Ideally you want to spend as less time as possible farming silver so you can afford to lose sets while playing the game.

To me they are 2 main category of silver generation.
- Passive generation
- Active generation

## Passive generation <a name="passive"></a>
These generation take very little efforts and no risk to gain you some silver. Most of them required some kind of investment.

### Farm plots <a name="farming"></a>
One of the easiest one to start as soon as you have premium is to update your island and use the lands to build a farm or herb garden.
Any vegetables or herbs will generate you money without any focus usage.
New players or players starving for silver shouldn't do any type of mount raising since they aren't profitable.

### Laborer island (aka slave island) <a name="laborer"></a>
This is something else you can do with your personal island is to build many houses, upgrade them and put laborer into them. Laborer are NPC that take a filled book and return it with some valuable goods after 22hrs. Since last patch, the return were nerf and it's not as profitable anymore.
This passive income have a pretty big investment and it usually take couple months before you see your return on investment.
If you go the laborer route, I would suggest to always used finish product laborer and not gathering one. The reason for this is finish product laborer can scale infinitly where gathering laborer can't.

### Using focus <a name="focus"></a>
This is most profitable passive income in game. It take next to no time to used and can be extremly profitable.
** What is focus **
Focus is a pool that is given to any premium player at the rate of 10k a day. You can have up to 30k focus (aka 3 days worth).
Biggest mistake to make is to not realize that focus is simply a pool of ressource that generate silver, reguarless of how you use it.

Focus can be used in 3 different categories.
- Farming
- Refining
- Crafting
